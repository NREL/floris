class GaussianModel():
    """
    This is the first draft of what will hopefully become the new gaussian class 
    Currently it contains a direct port of the Bastankhah gaussian class from previous
    A direct implementation of the Blondel model
    And a new GM model where we merge features a bit more of the two to ensure consistency with previous far-wake results
    of the Gaussian model, while implementing the Blondel model's smooth near-wake

    TODO: This needs to be much more expanded and including full references
