        uncertainty to the floris evaluations. One can specify a probability
        distribution function (pdf) for the ambient wind direction. Unless
        the exact pdf is specified manually using the option 'unc_pmfs', a
        Gaussian probability distribution function will be assumed.

        Args:
        configuration (:py:obj:`dict` or FlorisInterface object): The Floris
            object, configuration dictarionary, or YAML file. The
            configuration should have the following inputs specified.
                - **flow_field**: See `floris.simulation.flow_field.FlowField` for more details.
                - **farm**: See `floris.simulation.farm.Farm` for more details.
                - **turbine**: See `floris.simulation.turbine.Turbine` for more details.
                - **wake**: See `floris.simulation.wake.WakeManager` for more details.
                - **logging**: See `floris.simulation.floris.Floris` for more details.
        unc_options (dictionary, optional): A dictionary containing values
            used to create normally-distributed, zero-mean probability mass
            functions describing the distribution of wind direction deviations.
            This argument is only used when **unc_pmfs** is None and contain
            the following key-value pairs:
            -   **std_wd** (*float*): A float containing the standard
                deviation of the wind direction deviations from the
                original wind direction.
            -   **pmf_res** (*float*): A float containing the resolution in
                degrees of the wind direction and yaw angle PMFs.
            -   **pdf_cutoff** (*float*): A float containing the cumulative
                distribution function value at which the tails of the
                PMFs are truncated.
            Defaults to None. Initializes to {'std_wd': 4.95, 'pmf_res': 1.0,
            'pdf_cutoff': 0.995}.
        unc_pmfs (dictionary, optional): A dictionary containing optional
            probability mass functions describing the distribution of wind
            direction deviations. Contains the following key-value pairs:
            -   **wd_unc** (*np.array*): Wind direction deviations from the
                original wind direction.
            -   **wd_unc_pmf** (*np.array*): Probability of each wind
                direction deviation in **wd_unc** occuring.
            Defaults to None, in which case default PMFs are calculated
            using values provided in **unc_options**.
        fix_yaw_in_relative_frame (bool, optional): When set to True, the
            relative yaw angle of all turbines is fixed and always has the
            nominal value (e.g., 0 deg) when evaluating uncertainty in the
            wind direction. Evaluating  wind direction uncertainty like this
            will essentially come down to a Gaussian smoothing of FLORIS
            solutions over the wind directions. This calculation can therefore
            be really fast, since it does not require additional calculations
            compared to a non-uncertainty FLORIS evaluation.
            When fix_yaw_in_relative_frame=False, the yaw angles are fixed in
            the absolute (compass) reference frame, meaning that for each
            probablistic wind direction evaluation, our probablistic (relative)
            yaw angle evaluated goes into the opposite direction. For example,
            a probablistic wind direction 3 deg above the nominal value means
            that we evaluate it with a relative yaw angle that is 3 deg below
            its nominal value. This requires additional computations compared
            to a non- uncertainty evaluation.
            Typically, fix_yaw_in_relative_frame=True is used when comparing
            FLORIS to historical data, in which a single measurement usually
            represents a 10-minute average, and thus is often a mix of various
            true wind directions. The inherent assumption then is that the turbine
            perfectly tracks the wind direction changes within those 10 minutes.
            Then, fix_yaw_in_relative_frame=False is typically used for robust
            yaw angle optimization, in which we take into account that the turbine
            often does not perfectly know the true wind direction, and that a
            turbine often does not perfectly achieve its desired yaw angle offset.
            Defaults to fix_yaw_in_relative_frame=False.
