"""
The :py:obj:`floris` package contains :py:obj:`floris.utilities` module
and the modules that make up the FLORIS software. The floris simulation
modules are used to complete a wake simulation for a given wind farm
and turbine configuration.

All modules and package can be imported with

    >>> import floris

The ``__init__.py`` file enables the import of all modules in this
package so any additional modules should be included there.

# Since some of these depend on each other, the order
# that they are listed here does matter.
