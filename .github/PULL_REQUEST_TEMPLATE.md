IMPORTANT NOTES

Is this pull request ready to be merged?
- Do the existing tests pass and new tests added for new code?
- Is all development in a state where you are proud to share it with others and
  willing to ask other people to take the time to review it?
- Is it documented in such a way that a review can reasonably understand what you've
  done and why you've done it? Can other users understand how to use your changes?
If not but opening the pull request will facilitate development, make it a "draft" pull request

This form is written in GitHub's Markdown format. For a reference on this type
of syntax, see GitHub's documentation:
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax

This template contains guidance for your submission within the < ! - -, - - > blocks.
These are comments in HTML syntax and will not appear in the submission.
Be sure to use the "Preview" feature on GitHub to ensure your submission is formatted as intended.

When including code snippets, please paste the text itself and wrap the code block with
ticks (see the other character on the tilde ~ key in a US keyboard) to format it as code.
For example, Python code should be wrapped in ticks like this:
```python
def a_func():
    return 1

a = 1
b = a_func()
print(a + b)
```
This is preferred over screen shots since it is searchable and others can copy/paste
the text to run it.
