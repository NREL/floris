IMPORTANT NOTES

Thank you for taking the time to report a bug. If you aren't certain whether an issue
is a bug, please first open a Discussion. Before submitting, please reread your
description to ensure that other readers can reasonably understand the issue
you're facing and the impact on your workflow or results.

This form is written in GitHub's Markdown format. For a reference on this type
of syntax, see GitHub's documentation:
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax

This template contains guidance for your submission within the < ! - -, - - > blocks.
These are comments in HTML syntax and will not appear in the submission.
Be sure to use the "Preview" feature on GitHub to ensure your submission is formatted as intended.

When including code snippets, please paste the text itself and wrap the code block with
ticks (see the other character on the tilde ~ key in a US keyboard) to format it as code.
For example, Python code should be wrapped in ticks like this:
```python
def a_func():
    return 1

a = 1
b = a_func()
print(a + b)
```
This is preferred over screen shots since it is searchable and others can copy/paste
the text to run it.
