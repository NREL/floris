IMPORTANT NOTES

Thank you for taking the time to report a bug. If you aren't certain whether an issue
is a bug, please first open a Discussion. Before submitting, please reread your
description to ensure that other readers can reasonably understand the issue
you're facing and the impact on your workflow or results.

This form is written in GitHub's Markdown format. For a reference on this type
of syntax, see GitHub's documentation:
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax

When including code snippets, please paste the text itself and wrap the code block with
ticks (see the other character on the tilde ~ key in a US keyboard) to format it as code.
For example, Python code should be wrapped in ticks like this:
```python
def a_func():
    return 1

a = 1
b = a_func()
print(a + b)
```
This is preferred over screen shots since it is searchable and others can copy/paste
the text to run it.
-->

## How to reproduce
<!--

It is typically very helpful to reduce the problem as much as possible
and share a minimum working example. See the note above on including
