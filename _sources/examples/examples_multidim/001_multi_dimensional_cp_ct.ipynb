    "contains two additional conditions to define Cp/Ct values for: Tp for wave period, and Hs for wave\n",
    "height. For every combination of Tp and Hs defined, a Cp/Ct/Wind speed table of values is also\n",
    "defined. It is required for this .csv file to have the last 3 columns be ws, Cp, and Ct. In order\n",
    "for this table to be used, the flag 'multi_dimensional_cp_ct' must be present and set to true in\n",
    "the turbine definition. With this flag enabled, the solver will down-select to use the\n",
