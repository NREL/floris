    "After setting the FlorisModel and running, the next step is typically to get the power output\n",
    "of the turbines.  FLORIS has several methods for getting power:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `get_turbine_powers()`: Returns the power output of each turbine in the farm for each findex\n",
    "    (n_findex, n_turbines)\n",
    "2. `get_farm_power()`: Returns the total power output of the farm for each findex (n_findex)\n",
    "3. `get_expected_farm_power()`: Returns the combination of the farm power over each findex\n",
    "    with the frequency of each findex to get the expected farm power\n",
    "4. `get_farm_AEP()`: Multiplies the expected farm power by the number of hours in a year to get\n",
    "    the expected annual energy production (AEP) of the farm\n",
