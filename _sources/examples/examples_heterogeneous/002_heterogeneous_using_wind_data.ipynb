    "  1. Passing heterogeneous_inflow_config to the set method, with P points,\n",
    "        and speed_multipliers of size n_findex X P\n",
    "  2. More conveniently, building a HeterogeneousMap object that defines the speed_multipliers as a\n",
    "        function of wind direction and/or wind speed and passing that to a WindData object.  When\n",
