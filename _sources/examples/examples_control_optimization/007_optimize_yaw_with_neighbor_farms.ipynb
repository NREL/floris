    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to optimize the yaw angles of a subset of turbines\n",
    "in order to maximize the annual energy production (AEP) of a wind farm.  In this\n",
    "case, the wind farm is part of a larger collection of turbines, some of which are\n",
    "part of a neighboring farm.  The optimization is performed in two ways: first by\n",
    "accounting for the wakes of the neighboring farm (while not including those turbines)\n",
    "in the optimization as a target of yaw angle changes or including their power\n",
    "in the objective function.  In th second method the neighboring farms are removed\n",
    "from FLORIS for the optimization.  The AEP is then calculated for the optimized\n",
    "yaw angles (accounting for and not accounting for the neighboring farm) and compared\n",
    "to the baseline AEP.\n",
