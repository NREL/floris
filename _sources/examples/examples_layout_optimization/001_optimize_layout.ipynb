    "\"\"\"Example: Optimize Layout\n",
    "This example shows a simple layout optimization using the python module Scipy, optimizing for both\n",
    "annual energy production (AEP) and annual value production (AVP).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a 4 turbine array is optimized such that the layout of the turbine produces the\n",
    "highest AEP based on the given wind resource. The turbines\n",
    "are constrained to a square boundary and a random wind resource is supplied. The results\n",
    "of the optimization show that the turbines are pushed to near the outer corners of the boundary,\n",
    "which, given the generally uniform wind rose, makes sense in order to maximize the energy\n",
    "production by minimizing wake interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, with the same boundary, the same 4 turbine array is optimized to maximize AVP instead of AEP,\n",
    "using the value table defined in the WindRose object, where value represents the value of the\n",
    "energy produced for a given wind condition (e.g., the price of electricity). In this example, value\n",
    "is defined to be significantly higher for northerly and southerly wind directions, and zero when\n",
    "the wind is from the east or west. Because the value is much higher when the wind is from the north\n",
    "or south, the turbines are spaced apart roughly evenly in the x direction while being relatively\n",
    "close in the y direction to avoid wake interactions for northerly and southerly winds. Although the\n",
    "layout results in large wake losses when the wind is from the east or west, these losses do not\n",
    "significantly impact the objective function because of the low value for those wind directions.\n",
