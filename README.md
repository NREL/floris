# FLORIS Wake Modeling and Wind Farm Controls Software

FLORIS is a controls-focused wind farm simulation software incorporating
steady-state engineering wake models into a performance-focused Python
framework. It has been in active development at NREL since 2013 and the latest
release is [FLORIS v3.4](https://github.com/NREL/floris/releases/latest).
Online documentation is available at https://nrel.github.io/floris.

The software is in active development and engagement with the development team
is highly encouraged. If you are interested in using FLORIS to conduct studies
of a wind farm or extending FLORIS to include your own wake model, please join
the conversation in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/NREL/floris/discussions/)!

## Installation

**If upgrading from v2, it is highly recommended to install FLORIS V3 into a new virtual environment**.
Installing into a Python environment that contains FLORIS v2 may cause conflicts.
If you intend to use [pyOptSparse](https://mdolab-pyoptsparse.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/) with FLORIS,
it is recommended to install that package first before installing FLORIS.

FLORIS can be installed by downloading the source code or via the PyPI
package manager with `pip`.

The simplest method is with `pip` by using this command:

```bash
pip install floris
```

Developers and anyone who intends to inspect the source code
can install FLORIS by downloading the git repository
from GitHub with ``git`` and use ``pip`` to locally install it.
It is highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment manager
such as [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
in order to maintain a clean and sandboxed environment. The following
commands in a terminal or shell will download and install FLORIS.

```bash
    # Download the source code from the `main` branch
    git clone -b main https://github.com/NREL/floris.git

    # If using conda, be sure to activate your environment prior to installing
    # conda activate <env name>

    # If using pyOptSpare, install it first
    conda install -c conda-forge pyoptsparse

    # Install FLORIS
    pip install -e floris
```

With both methods, the installation can be verified by opening a Python interpreter
and importing FLORIS:

```python
    >>> import floris
    >>> help(floris)

features, improvements, and bug fixes will be issued on an ongoing basis.

## Quick Start

FLORIS is a Python package run on the command line typically by providing
an input file with an initial configuration. It can be installed with
```pip install floris``` (see [installation](https://github.nrel.io/floris/installation)).
The typical entry point is
[FlorisInterface](https://nrel.github.io/floris/_autosummary/floris.tools.floris_interface.FlorisInterface.html#floris.tools.floris_interface.FlorisInterface)
which accepts the path to the input file as an argument. From there,
changes can be made to the initial configuration through the
[FlorisInterface.reinitialize](https://nrel.github.io/floris/_autosummary/floris.tools.floris_interface.FlorisInterface.html#floris.tools.floris_interface.FlorisInterface.reinitialize)
routine, and the simulation is executed with
[FlorisInterface.calculate_wake](https://nrel.github.io/floris/_autosummary/floris.tools.floris_interface.FlorisInterface.html#floris.tools.floris_interface.FlorisInterface.calculate_wake).

```python
from floris.tools import FlorisInterface
fi = FlorisInterface("path/to/input.yaml")
fi.reinitialize(wind_directions=[i for i in range(10)])
fi.calculate_wake()
```

Finally, results can be analyzed via post-processing functions available within
[FlorisInterface](https://nrel.github.io/floris/_autosummary/floris.tools.floris_interface.FlorisInterface.html#floris.tools.floris_interface.FlorisInterface)
such as
- [FlorisInterface.get_turbine_layout](https://nrel.github.io/floris/_autosummary/floris.tools.floris_interface.FlorisInterface.html#floris.tools.floris_interface.FlorisInterface.get_turbine_layout)
- [FlorisInterface.get_turbine_powers](https://nrel.github.io/floris/_autosummary/floris.tools.floris_interface.FlorisInterface.html#floris.tools.floris_interface.FlorisInterface.get_turbine_powers)
- [FlorisInterface.get_farm_AEP](https://nrel.github.io/floris/_autosummary/floris.tools.floris_interface.FlorisInterface.html#floris.tools.floris_interface.FlorisInterface.get_farm_AEP)

and in a visualization package at [floris.tools.visualization](https://nrel.github.io/floris/_autosummary/floris.tools.floris_interface.FlorisInterface.html#floris.tools.visualization).
A collection of examples describing the creation of simulations as well as
analysis and post processing are included in the
[repository](https://github.com/NREL/floris/tree/main/examples)
and described in detail in [Examples Index](https://github.nrel.io/floris/examples).

## Engaging on GitHub

FLORIS leverages the following GitHub features to coordinate support and development efforts:

- [Discussions](https://github.com/NREL/floris/discussions): Collaborate to develop ideas for new use cases, features, and software designs, and get support for usage questions
- [Issues](https://github.com/NREL/floris/issues): Report potential bugs and well-developed feature requests
- [Projects](https://github.com/orgs/NREL/projects/18/): Include current and future work on a timeline and assign a person to "own" it

Generally, the first entry point for the community will be within one of the
categories in Discussions.
[Ideas](https://github.com/NREL/floris/discussions/categories/ideas) is a great spot to develop the
details for a feature request. [Q&A](https://github.com/NREL/floris/discussions/categories/q-a)
is where to get usage support.
[Show and tell](https://github.com/NREL/floris/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) is a free-form
space to show off the things you are doing with FLORIS.
