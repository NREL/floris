    "# Wake Models\n",
    "\n",
    "A wake model in FLORIS is made up of four components that together constitute a wake.\n",
    "At minimum, the velocity deficit profile behind a wind turbine is required. For most models,\n",
    "an additional wake deflection model is included to model the effect of yaw misalignment.\n",
    "Turbulence models are also available to couple with the deficit and deflection components.\n",
    "Finally, methods for combining wakes with the rest of the flow field are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computationally, the solver algorithm and grid-type supported by each wake model can also\n",
    "be considered as part of the model itself. As shown in the diagram below, the mathematical\n",
    "formulations can be considered as the main components of the model. These are typically\n",
    "associated directly to each other and in some cases they are bundled together into\n",
    "a single mathematical formulation. The solver algorithm and grid type are associated\n",
    "to the math formulation, but they are typically more generic.\n",

It was originally presented as a “top-hat” model in {cite:t}`nygaard2020modelling` and was updated in {cite:t}`Pedersen_2022_turbopark2` to have a Gaussian profile. For the latter, Ørsted released the [Matlab code with documentation](https://github.com/OrstedRD/TurbOPark), which allows the verification of the implementation in FLORIS.\n",

    "The first implementation, the [`TurboparkVelocityDeficitModel`](https://github.com/NREL/floris/blob/main/floris/core/wake_velocity/turbopark.py), was released in [FLORIS v3.1](https://github.com/NREL/floris/releases/tag/v3.1). The second implementation, the [`TurboparkgaussVelocityDeficitModel`](https://github.com/NREL/floris/blob/main/floris/core/wake_velocity/turboparkgauss.py), was released in FLORIS v4.2 and shows a near-perfect match to the predictions of Ørsted’s Matlab implementation. As such, we will emphasize the use of the `TurboparkgaussVelocityDeficitModel` going forward, and suggest that new users use this model (by setting the `velocity_model` field of the FLORIS input file to `turboparkgauss` instead of the `TurboparkVelocityDeficitModel` (`velocity_model: turbopark`)) if they are interested in testing the TurbOPark model.\n",
