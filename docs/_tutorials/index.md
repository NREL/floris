# Intro to using FLORIS

The FLORIS software is a Python package that must be incorporated into
a custom script to define a wind farm and atmospheric conditions, run
the chosen simulation, and analyze the results. At a high level, FLORIS
requires a set of inputs in a dictionary data structure. To access the
results, a script must probe the internal data structures to retrieve
the required data.
