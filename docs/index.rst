FLORIS Wake Modeling Utility
----------------------------
For technical questions regarding FLORIS usage please first search for or post
your questions to
`stackoverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/floris>`_ using
the **floris** tag. Alternatively, email the NREL FLORIS team at
`NREL.Floris@nrel.gov <mailto:floris@nrel.gov>`_.

Background and Objectives
=========================
This FLORIS framework is designed to provide a computationally inexpensive,
controls-oriented modeling tool of the steady-state wake characteristics in
a wind farm. The wake models implemented in this version of FLORIS are:

- Jensen model for velocity deficit
- Jimenez model for wake deflection
- Multi zone model for velocity deficit
- Gaussian models for wake deflection and velocity deficit
- Gauss-Curl-Hybrid (GCH) model for second-order wake steering effects
- Curl  model for wake deflection and velocity deficit
- TurbOPark model for wake velocity deficit

Further, all wake models can now be overlayed onto spatially heterogenous
inflows. More information on all models can be found in :ref:`theory`.

FLORIS further includes a suite of design and analysis tools useful in wind farm
control and co-designed layout optimization.  Examples include:

- Methods for optimization and design of wind farm control and layout
- Visualization methods for flow analysis
- Methods for wind rose and annual energy production analysis
- Methods for analysis of field campaigns of wind farm control
- Coupling methods to other tools, including SOWFA and CC-Blade
- Methods to model heterogenous atmospheric conditions

Example applications of these tools are provided in the `examples/` folder, and
it is highly recommended that new users begin with those in
`examples/_getting_started`.

See :cite:`ind-annoni2018analysis` for practical information on using floris as
a modeling and simulation tool for controls research.
