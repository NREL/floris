# Code quality

This page contains information on various code quality metrics
that are collected during the development cycle. Some of these
are autogenerated while others rely on manual scripts and updating
the documentation, so these will be updating as needed and when
appropriate. All plots show the corresponding commit hash
when hovering over a point with the mouse pointer.
