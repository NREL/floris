    "# Turbine Operation Models\n",

    "Separate from the turbine models, which define the physical characterstics of the turbines, FLORIS\n",
    "allows users to specify how the turbine behaves in terms of producing power and thurst. We refer to \n",
    "different models for turbine behavior as \"operation models\". A key feature of operation models is\n",
    "the ability for users to specify control setpoints at which the operation model will be evaluated. \n",
    "For instance, some operation models allow users to specify `yaw_angles`, which alter the power \n",
    "being produced by the turbine along with it's thrust force on flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operation models are specified by the `operation_model` key on the turbine yaml file, or by using\n",
    "the `set_operation_model()` method on `FlorisModel`. Each operation model available in FLORIS is\n",
    "described and demonstrated below. The simplest operation model is the `\"simple\"` operation model,\n",
    "which takes no control setpoints and simply evaluates the power and thrust coefficient curves for \n",
    "the turbine at the current wind condition. The default operation model is the `\"cosine-loss\"`\n",
    "operation model, which models the loss in power of a turbine under yaw misalignment using a cosine\n",
    "term with an exponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first provide a quick demonstration of how to switch between different operation models. Then, \n",

    "The `\"controller-dependent\"` operation model is an advanced operation model that uses the turbine's Cp/Ct\n",
    "surface to optimize performance under yaw misalignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `\"controller-dependent\"` operation model determines the wind turbine power output in yaw misalignment conditions, taking into account the effects of the control system. \n",
    "When the rotor operates in below-rated conditions, the models assumes that blade pitch is equal to the optimal value (corresponding to maximum power coefficient $C_P$),\n",
    "while the generator torque is scheduled as a function of rotational speed $\\omega$ according to the $K\\omega^2$ law.\n",
    "The $K$ coefficient is computed using the condition of maximum efficiency as shown in Chapter 7 of {cite:t}`hansen_book`.\n",
    "When the turbine operates above rated wind speed, the rotor speed is fixed and equal to the rated value, while the pitch angle is used to keep the power output equal to rated. \n",
    "The `\"controller-dependent\"` operation model solves a balance equation between electrical power and aerodynamic power, assuming the aforementioned control strategies.\n",
    "This yields the pitch and torque values that correspond to the current inflow and yaw misalignment. Based on these quantities, the power output of the turbine is computed.\n",
    "Because the balance equation must be solved, the `ControllerDependentTurbine` is slower to execute than some other operation models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `\"controller-dependent\"` operation model considers the effect of vertical shear. Hence, the wind turbine can perform differently depending on the direction of misalignment.\n",
    "Vertical shear is computed locally at each rotor, so it can be affected by wake impingement. The model includes both the effects of yaw and tilt on rotor performance.\n",
    "To include the effects of shear, ensure that `turbine_grid_points` is greater than 1 in the main FLORIS configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `\"controller-dependent\"` operation model requires the definition of some parameters that depend on the turbine:\n",
    "1) Rated rotation speed (`rated_rpm`), generator efficiency (`generator_efficiency`), and rated power, specified in kW (`rated_power`).\n",
    "2) Three parameters that describe the aerodynamics of the blade, namely `beta` (twist), `cd` (drag) and `cl_alfa` (lift slope).\n",
    "These parameters are provided for the NREL 5MW, IEA 10MW, and IEA 15MW turbines in the \"floris/turbine_library/\".\n",
    "When using a different turbine model, these parameters can be estimated as shown in Section 3.5 of {cite:t}`tamaro2024beyondcosine`. \n",
    "3) Look-up tables of the power coefficient ($C_P$) and thrust coefficient $C_T$ as functions of tip-speed ratio and blade pitch angle.\n",
    "Approximate values for these are provided for the reference turbines in \"floris/turbine_library/\".\n",
    "4) Rotor solidity (`rotor_solidity`), i.e. the fraction of the rotor area occupied by the blades.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further details can be found in {cite:t}`tamaro2024beyondcosine`.\n",
    "Developed and implemented by Simone Tamaro, Filippo Campagnolo, and Carlo L. Bottasso at Technische Universität München (TUM) (email: simone.tamaro@tum.de)."
