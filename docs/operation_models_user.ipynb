    "# Turbine Operation Models\n",

    "Separate from the turbine models, which define the physical characterstics of the turbines, FLORIS\n",
    "allows users to specify how the turbine behaves in terms of producing power and thurst. We refer to \n",
    "different models for turbine behavior as \"operation models\". A key feature of operation models is\n",
    "the ability for users to specify control setpoints at which the operation model will be evaluated. \n",
    "For instance, some operation models allow users to specify `yaw_angles`, which alter the power \n",
    "being produced by the turbine along with it's thrust force on flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operation models are specified by the `operation_model` key on the turbine yaml file, or by using\n",
    "the `set_operation_model()` method on `FlorisModel`. Each operation model available in FLORIS is\n",
    "described and demonstrated below. The simplest operation model is the `\"simple\"` operation model,\n",
    "which takes no control setpoints and simply evaluates the power and thrust coefficient curves for \n",
    "the turbine at the current wind condition. The default operation model is the `\"cosine-loss\"`\n",
    "operation model, which models the loss in power of a turbine under yaw misalignment using a cosine\n",
    "term with an exponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first provide a quick demonstration of how to switch between different operation models. Then, \n",
