Background and Objectives
=========================
This FLORIS framework is designed to provide a computationally efficient,
controls-oriented modeling tool of the steady-state wake characteristics in
a wind farm. The wake models implemented in this version of FLORIS are:

- Jensen model for velocity deficit
- Jimenez model for wake deflection
- Gauss model for wake deflection and velocity deficit
- Multi zone model for wake deflection and velocity deficit
- Curl  model for wake deflection and velocity deficit
- TurbOPark model for wake velocity deficit

More information on all of these models can be found in the
`theory <https://floris.readthedocs.io/en/develop/source/theory.html>`_
section of the online documentation.

A couple of publications with practical information on using floris as a
modeling and simulation tool for controls research are

Installation
============
For full installation instructions, see
https://floris.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/installation.html.

Users who want to run FLORIS without downloading the full source code
can install with `pip` or `conda`, as shown below.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Using pip...
    pip install floris         # Latest version
    pip install floris==1.1.0  # Specified version number

    # Using conda...
    conda install floris        # Latest version
    conda install floris=1.1.0  # Specified version number


To download the source code and use the local code, download the project
and add it to your Python path:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Download the source code.
    git clone https://github.com/NREL/floris.git

    # Install into your Python environment
    pip install -e floris


Finally, users who will be contributing code to the project should align
their environment with the linting and formatting tools used by the
FLORIS development team. This is enabled in the `setup.py` script and
can be activated with these commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/NREL/floris.git -b develop
    cd floris
    pip install -e '.[develop]'
    pre-commit install


After any form of installation, the environment should be tested.
Within a Python shell or a Python script, this code should
display information:

.. code-block:: python

    import floris
    print( help( floris ) )
    print( dir( floris ) )
    print( help( floris.simulation ) )
