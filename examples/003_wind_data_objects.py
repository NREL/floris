"""Example 3: Wind Data Objects

This example demonstrates the use of wind data objects in FLORIS:
 TimeSeries, WindRose, and WindTIRose.

 For each of the WindData objects, examples are shown of:

    1) Initializing the object
    2) Broadcasting values
    3) Converting between objects
    4) Setting TI and value
    5) Plotting
    6) Setting the FLORIS model using the object

# Initializing
##################################################

# FLORIS provides a set of wind data objects to hold the ambient wind conditions in a
# convenient classes that include capabilities and methods to manipulate and visualize
# the data.

# The TimeSeries class is used to hold time series data, such as wind speed, wind direction,
# and turbulence intensity.

# There is also a "value" wind data variable, which represents the value of the power
# generated at each time step or wind condition (e.g., the price of electricity). This can
# then be used in later optimization methods to optimize for quantities besides AEP.

# Generate wind speeds, directions, turbulence intensities, and values via random signals
N = 100
wind_speeds = 8 + 2 * np.random.randn(N)
wind_directions = 270 + 30 * np.random.randn(N)
turbulence_intensities = 0.06 + 0.02 * np.random.randn(N)
values = 25 + 10 * np.random.randn(N)

time_series = TimeSeries(
    wind_directions=wind_directions,
    wind_speeds=wind_speeds,
    turbulence_intensities=turbulence_intensities,
    values=values,
)

# The WindRose class is used to hold wind rose data, such as wind speed, wind direction,
# and frequency.  TI and value are represented as bin averages per wind direction and
# speed bin.
wind_directions = np.arange(0, 360, 3.0)
wind_speeds = np.arange(4, 20, 2.0)

# Make TI table 6% TI for all wind directions and speeds
ti_table = 0.06 * np.ones((len(wind_directions), len(wind_speeds)))

# Make value table 25 for all wind directions and speeds
value_table =25 * np.ones((len(wind_directions), len(wind_speeds)))

# Uniform frequency
freq_table = np.ones((len(wind_directions), len(wind_speeds)))
freq_table = freq_table / np.sum(freq_table)

wind_rose = WindRose(
    wind_directions=wind_directions,
    wind_speeds=wind_speeds,
    ti_table=ti_table,
    freq_table=freq_table,
    value_table=value_table,
)

# The WindTIRose class is similar to the WindRose table except that TI is also binned
# making the frequency table a 3D array.
turbulence_intensities = np.arange(0.05, 0.15, 0.01)

# Uniform frequency
freq_table = np.ones((len(wind_directions), len(wind_speeds), len(turbulence_intensities)))

# Uniform value
value_table = 25* np.ones((len(wind_directions), len(wind_speeds), len(turbulence_intensities)))

##################################################
# Broadcasting
##################################################

# A convenience method of the wind data objects is that, unlike the lower-level
# FlorisModel.set() method, the wind data objects can broadcast upward data provided
# as a scalar to the full array.  This is useful for setting the same wind conditions
# for all turbines in a wind farm.

# For TimeSeries, as long as one condition is given as an array, the other 2
# conditions can be given as scalars.  The TimeSeries object will broadcast the
# scalars to the full array (uniform)
wind_directions = 270 + 30 * np.random.randn(N)
time_series = TimeSeries(
    wind_directions=wind_directions, wind_speeds=8.0, turbulence_intensities=0.06
)


# For WindRose, wind directions and wind speeds must be given as arrays, but the
# ti_table can be supplied as a scalar which will apply uniformly to all wind
# directions and speeds.  Not supplying a freq table will similarly generate
# a uniform frequency table.
wind_directions = np.arange(0, 360, 3.0)
wind_speeds = np.arange(4, 20, 2.0)
wind_rose = WindRose(wind_directions=wind_directions, wind_speeds=wind_speeds, ti_table=0.06)


##################################################
# Wind Rose from Time Series
##################################################

# The TimeSeries class has a method to generate a wind rose from a time series based on binning
wind_rose = time_series.to_WindRose(wd_edges=np.arange(0, 360, 3.0), ws_edges=np.arange(2, 20, 2.0))

##################################################
# Wind Rose from long CSV FILE
##################################################

# The WindRose class can also be initialized from a long CSV file.  By long what is meant is
# that the file has a column for each wind direction, wind speed combination.  The file can
# also specify the mean TI per bin and the frequency of each bin as seperate columns.

# If the TI is not provided, can specify a fixed TI for all bins using the ti_col_or_value
# input
wind_rose_from_csv = WindRose.read_csv_long(
    "inputs/wind_rose.csv", wd_col="wd", ws_col="ws", freq_col="freq_val", ti_col_or_value=0.06
)

##################################################
# Aggregating and Resampling the Wind Rose
##################################################

# The aggregate function allows for aggregation of the wind rose data into
# fewer wind direction and wind speed bins.
# Note it will throw an error if the step sizes passed in are smaller than the
# step sizes of the original data.
wind_rose_aggregate = wind_rose.aggregate(wd_step=10, ws_step=2)

# For upsampling, the resample_by_interpolation function can be used to interpolate
# the wind rose data to a finer grid.  It can use either linear or nearest neighbor
wind_rose_resample = wind_rose.resample_by_interpolation(wd_step=0.5, ws_step=0.25)

##################################################
# Setting turbulence intensity
##################################################

# Each of the wind data objects also has the ability to set the turbulence intensity
# according to a function of wind speed and direction.  This can be done using a custom
# function by using the assign_ti_using_wd_ws_function method. There is also a method
# called assign_ti_using_IEC_method which assigns TI based on the IEC 61400-1 standard.
wind_rose.assign_ti_using_IEC_method()  # Assign using default settings for Iref and offset

##################################################
# Setting value
##################################################

# Similarly, each of the wind data objects also has the ability to set the value according to
# a function of wind speed and direction.  This can be done using a custom function by using
# the assign_value_using_wd_ws_function method. There is also a method called
# assign_value_piecewise_linear which assigns value based on a linear piecewise function of
# wind speed.

# Assign value using default settings. This produces a value vs. wind speed that approximates
# the normalized mean electricity price vs. wind speed curve for the SPP market in the U.S.
# for years 2018-2020 from figure 7 in "The value of wake steering wind farm flow control in
# US energy markets," Wind Energy Science, 2024. https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-9-219-2024.

##################################################
# Plotting Wind Data Objects
##################################################

# Certain plotting methods are included to enable visualization of the wind data objects
# Plotting a wind rose
wind_rose.plot()

# Plot a wind rose with the wind directions aggregated into 10-deg bins
wind_rose.plot(wd_step=10)

# Showing TI over wind speed for a WindRose
wind_rose.plot_ti_over_ws()

# Showing value over wind speed for a WindRose

##################################################
# Setting the FLORIS model via wind data
##################################################

# Each of the wind data objects can be used to set the FLORIS model by passing
# them in as is to the set method.  The FLORIS model will then use the member functions
# of the wind data to extract the wind conditions for the simulation.  Frequency tables
# are also extracted for expected power and AEP-like calculations.
# Similarly the value data is extracted and maintained.

fmodel = FlorisModel("inputs/gch.yaml")

# Set the wind conditions using the TimeSeries object
fmodel.set(wind_data=time_series)

# Set the wind conditions using the WindRose object
fmodel.set(wind_data=wind_rose)

# Note that in the case of the wind_rose, under the default settings, wind direction and wind speed
# bins for which frequency is zero are not simulated.  This can be changed by setting the
# compute_zero_freq_occurrence parameter to True.
