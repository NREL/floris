"""
This example follows the same setup as example 01 to createa a FLORIS instance and:
1) Makes a two-turbine layout
2) Demonstrates single ws/wd simulations
3) Demonstrates mulitple ws/wd simulations

with the modification of using a turbine definition that has a multi-dimensional Cp/Ct table.

In the input file `gch_multi_dim_cp_ct.yaml`, the turbine_type points to a turbine definition,
iea_15MW_floating_multi_dim_cp_ct.yaml located in the turbine_library,
that supplies a multi-dimensional Cp/Ct data file in the form of a .csv file. This .csv file
contains two additional conditions to define Cp/Ct values for: Tp for wave period, and Hs for wave
height. For every combination of Tp and Hs defined, a Cp/Ct/Wind speed table of values is also
defined. It is required for this .csv file to have the last 3 columns be ws, Cp, and Ct. In order
for this table to be used, the flag 'multi_dimensional_cp_ct' must be present and set to true in
the turbine definition. Also of note is the 'velocity_model' must be set to 'multidim_cp_ct' in
the main input file. With both of these values provided, the solver will downselect to use the
interpolant defined at the closest conditions. The user must supply these conditions in the
main input file under the 'flow_field' section, e.g.:

NOTE: The multi-dimensional Cp/Ct data used in this example is fictional for the purposes of
facilitating this example. The Cp/Ct values for the different wave conditions are scaled
values of the original Cp/Ct data for the IEA 15MW turbine.

flow_field:
  multidim_conditions:
    Tp: 2.5
    Hs: 3.01

The solver will then use the nearest-neighbor interpolant. These conditions are currently global
and used to select the interpolant at each turbine.

Also note in the example below that there is a specific method for computing powers when
using turbines with multi-dimensional Cp/Ct data under FlorisInterface, called
'get_turbine_powers_multidim'. The normal 'get_turbine_powers' method will not work.
