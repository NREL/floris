"""
This example shows a simple layout optimization using the python module Scipy.

A 4 turbine array is optimized such that the layout of the turbine produces the
highest annual energy production (AEP) based on the given wind resource. The turbines
are constrained to a square boundary and a random wind resource is supplied. The results
of the optimization show that the turbines are pushed to the outer corners of the boundary,
which makes sense in order to maximize the energy production by minimizing wake interactions.
