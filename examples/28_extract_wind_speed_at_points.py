"""
This example demonstrates the use of the sample_flow_at_points method of
FlorisInterface. sample_flow_at_points extracts the wind speed
information at user-specified locations in the flow.

Specifically, this example returns the wind speed at a single x, y
location and four different heights over a sweep of wind directions.
This mimics the wind speed measurements of a met mast across all
wind directions (at a fixed free stream wind speed).

Try different values for met_mast_option to vary the location of the
met mast within the two-turbine farm.
