"""
This example demonstrates how to calculate the Annual Energy Production (AEP) of a wind farm using wind rose
information stored in a .csv file.

The wind rose information is first loaded, after which we initialize our Floris Interface. A 3 turbine farm is
generated, and then the turbine wakes and powers are calculated across all the wind directions. Finally, the farm power
is converted to AEP and reported out.
