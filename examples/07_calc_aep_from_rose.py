"""
This example demonstrates how to calculate the Annual Energy Production (AEP)
of a wind farm using wind rose information stored in a .csv file.

The wind rose information is first loaded, after which we initialize our Floris
Interface. A 3 turbine farm is generated, and then the turbine wakes and powers
are calculated across all the wind directions. Finally, the farm power is
converted to AEP and reported out.

# to manually derive how the variables are sorted and how to reshape the
# one-dimensional frequency array, we use a nearest neighbor interpolant. This
# ensures the frequency values are mapped appropriately to the new 2D array.

# The wake calculations are skipped for any wind speed below respectively
# above the cut-in and cut-out wind speed. This can speed up computation and
