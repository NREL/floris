"""Example: Heterogeneous Inflow using wind data

When multiple cases are considered, the heterogeneous inflow conditions can be defined in two ways:

  1. Passing heterogeneous_inflow_config to the set method, with P points,
        and speed_multipliers of size n_findex X P
  2. More conveniently, building a HeterogeneousMap object that defines the speed_multipliers as a
        function of wind direction and/or wind speed and passing that to a WindData object.  When
        the WindData object is passed to the set method, the heterogeneous_inflow_config is
        automatically generated for each findex by finding the nearest wind direction and/or wind
        speed in the HeterogeneousMap object.

This example:

    1) Implements heterogeneous inflow for a 4 turbine layout using both of the above methods
    2) Compares the results of the two methods and shows that they are equivalent
