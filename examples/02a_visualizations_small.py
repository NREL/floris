"""
This example initializes the FLORIS software, and then uses internal
functions to run a simulation and plot the results. In this case,
we are plotting three slices of the resulting flow field:
1. Horizontal slice parallel to the ground and located at the hub height
2. Vertical slice of parallel with the direction of the wind
3. Veritical slice parallel to to the turbine disc plane

Additionally, an alternative method of plotting a horizontal slice
is shown. Rather than calculating points in the domain behind a turbine,
this method adds an additional turbine to the farm and moves it to
locations throughout the farm while calculating the velocity at it's
rotor.

# Initialize FLORIS with the given input file via FlorisInterface.
# For basic usage, FlorisInterface provides a simplified and expressive
# entry point to the simulation routines.
fi = FlorisInterface("inputs/gch.yaml")

# The rotor plots show what is happening at each turbine, but we do not
# see what is happening between each turbine. For this, we use a
# grid that has points regularly distributed throughout the fluid domain.
# The FlorisInterface contains functions for configuring the new grid,
# running the simulation, and generating plots of 2D slices of the
# flow field.

# Note this visualization grid created within the calculate_horizontal_plane function will be reset
# to what existed previously at the end of the function
