"""
This example demonstrates how to specify a turbine model based on a power
and thrust curve for the wind turbine, as well as possible physical parameters
(which default to the parameters of the NREL 5MW reference turbine).

Note that it is also possible to have a .yaml created, if the file_path
argument to build_turbine_dict is set.
