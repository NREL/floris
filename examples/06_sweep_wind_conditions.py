"""
This example demonstrates the vectorized wake calculation for
a set of wind speeds and directions combinations. When given
a list of conditions, FLORIS leverages features of the CPU
to perform chunks of the computations at once rather than
looping over each condition.

This calculation is performed for a single-row 5 turbine farm.  In addition
to plotting the powers of the individual turbines, an energy by turbine
calculation is made and plotted by summing over the wind speed and wind direction
axes of the power matrix returned by get_turbine_powers()
